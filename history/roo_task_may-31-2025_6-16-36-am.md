[ERROR] You did not use a tool in your previous response! Please retry with a tool use.

# Reminder: Instructions for Tool Use

Tool uses are formatted using XML-style tags. The tool name itself becomes the XML tag name. Each parameter is enclosed within its own set of tags. Here's the structure:

<actual_tool_name>
<parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
<parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
...
</actual_tool_name>

For example, to use the attempt_completion tool:

<attempt_completion>
<result>
I have completed the task...
</result>
</attempt_completion>

Always use the actual tool name as the XML tag name for proper parsing and execution.

# Next Steps

If you have completed the user's task, use the attempt_completion tool. 
If you require additional information from the user, use the ask_followup_question tool. 
Otherwise, if you have not completed the task and do not need additional information, then proceed with the next step of the task.
