**Assistant:**

<attempt_completion>
<result>
I've updated both the README.md and CHANGELOG.md files to better reflect that this is an MCP server that acts as a proxy to the Perplexica API, rather than implementing the search features directly.

**Key changes made:**

**README.md:**
- Clarified that the server "acts as a proxy" to provide LLM access to Perplexica
- Changed the features section to "What This MCP Server Provides" focusing on its role as a proxy
- Emphasized that it provides a single search tool, acts as an API bridge, and forwards parameters
- Replaced detailed feature descriptions with a clear explanation that parameters are passed through to Perplexica
- Added reference to Perplexica's own documentation for detailed feature information

**CHANGELOG.md:**
- Updated the description to emphasize it's a "proxy to Perplexica API"
- Simplified the feature list to focus on the MCP server's proxy functionality
- Removed detailed feature descriptions that belong to the underlying Perplexica service
- Focused on parameter passthrough and MCP interface capabilities

Both files now accurately represent this as an MCP server that serves as a proxy/bridge to the actual Perplexica service, rather than claiming to implement Perplexica's features directly.
