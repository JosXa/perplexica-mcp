**Assistant:**

<thinking>
I need to write a good rules.md file for Roocode and put it into the .roo folder. Let me first understand what this project is about by looking at the current files and structure.

From the environment details, I can see this is a perplexica-mcp project with Python files. I should first check if the .roo folder exists, and if not, create it. Then I need to write a comprehensive rules.md file that would be appropriate for a Roocode project.

Let me start by checking if the .roo folder exists and understanding the project structure better.
</thinking>

I'll help you create a comprehensive rules.md file for Roocode in the .roo folder. Let me first check the current project structure and then create the appropriate rules file.

<list_files>
<path>.</path>
<recursive>true</recursive>
</list_files>

  1 | # Perplexica MCP Server
  2 | 
  3 | Perplexica MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that acts as a proxy to provide LLM access to Perplexica's AI-powered search engine. This server enables AI assistants and other MCP clients to perform searches through the Perplexica API.
  4 | 
  5 | ## What This MCP Server Provides
  6 | 
  7 | - **Single Search Tool**: Exposes Perplexica's search functionality as an MCP tool
  8 | - **API Proxy**: Acts as a bridge between MCP clients and the Perplexica search endpoint
  9 | - **Parameter Passthrough**: Forwards all search parameters (focus modes, models, etc.) to the Perplexica API
 10 | - **MCP Protocol Compliance**: Implements the Model Context Protocol for seamless integration with AI assistants
 11 | 
 12 | ## Installation
 13 | 
 14 | To use the Perplexica MCP Server, you'll need to have Python 3.12 or later installed on your system.
 15 | 
 16 | 1. Clone this repository:
 17 | 
 18 |   ```bash
 19 |   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/perplexica-mcp.git
 20 |   cd perplexica-mcp
 21 |   ```
 22 | 
 23 | 2. Install the required dependencies:
 24 | 
 25 |   ```bash
 26 |   pip install -e .
 27 |   ```
 28 | 
 29 | ## MCP Server Configuration
 30 | 
 31 | This server is designed to be used with MCP-compatible clients. Add the following configuration to your MCP client:
 32 | 
 33 | ```json
 34 | {
 35 |   "mcpServers": {
 36 |     "perplexica": {
 37 |       "command": "uv",
 38 |       "args": ["run", "/path/to/perplexica-mcp/perplexica_mcp_tool.py"],
 39 |       "env": {
 40 |         "PERPLEXICA_BACKEND_URL": "http://localhost:3000/api/search"
 41 |       }
 42 |     }
 43 |   }
 44 | }
 45 | ```
 46 | 
 47 | ## Backend URL Configuration
 48 | 
 49 | The Perplexica MCP Server uses an environment variable to configure the backend URL. To set this up:
 50 | 
 51 | 1. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project (if it doesn't already exist)
 52 | 2. Add the `PERPLEXICA_BACKEND_URL` variable with your desired backend URL:
 53 | 
 54 | ```ini
 55 | PERPLEXICA_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/search
 56 | ```
 57 | 
 58 | The server will use this URL to communicate with the Perplexica backend. If the environment variable is not set, it will default to `http://localhost:3000/api/search`.
 59 | 
 60 | ## Usage
 61 | 
 62 | This MCP server provides a `search` tool that can be used by MCP clients to perform searches through Perplexica. The tool accepts the following parameters:
 63 | 
 64 | ### Search Tool Parameters
 65 | 
 66 | - `query` (required): The search query string
 67 | - `focus_mode` (required): The search focus mode
 68 | - `chat_model` (optional): Chat model configuration
 69 | - `embedding_model` (optional): Embedding model configuration

 77 | When connected to an MCP client, you can use the search tool like this:
 78 | 
 79 | ```none
 80 | Search for "Python programming best practices" using webSearch focus mode
 81 | ```
 82 | 
 83 | The MCP client will automatically invoke the search tool with the appropriate parameters.
 84 | 
 85 | ## Perplexica Integration
 86 | 
 87 | This MCP server acts as a proxy to the Perplexica search API. All search parameters and configurations are passed through to the underlying Perplexica service:
 88 | 
 89 | - **Focus Modes**: Supports all Perplexica focus modes (webSearch, academicSearch, writingAssistant, wolframAlphaSearch, youtubeSearch, redditSearch)
 90 | - **Model Configuration**: Passes through chat model and embedding model settings to Perplexica
 91 | - **Search Options**: Forwards optimization modes, conversation history, and system instructions
