 1 | # Perplexica MCP Server
 2 | 
 3 | Perplexica MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that acts as a proxy to provide LLM access to Perplexica's AI-powered search engine. This server enables AI assistants and other MCP clients to perform searches through the Perplexica API.
 4 | 
 5 | ## What This MCP Server Provides
 6 | 
 7 | - **Single Search Tool**: Exposes Perplexica's search functionality as an MCP tool
 8 | - **API Proxy**: Acts as a bridge between MCP clients and the Perplexica search endpoint
 9 | - **Parameter Passthrough**: Forwards all search parameters (focus modes, models, etc.) to the Perplexica API
10 | - **MCP Protocol Compliance**: Implements the Model Context Protocol for seamless integration with AI assistants
11 | 
12 | ## Installation
13 | 
14 | To use the Perplexica MCP Server, you'll need to have Python 3.7 or later installed on your system.
15 | 
16 | 1. Clone this repository:
17 |    ```
18 |    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/perplexica-mcp.git
19 |    cd perplexica-mcp
20 |    ```
21 | 
22 | 2. Install the required dependencies:
23 |    ```
24 |    pip install -r requirements.txt
25 |    ```
26 | 
27 | ## MCP Server Configuration
28 | 
29 | This server is designed to be used with MCP-compatible clients. Add the following configuration to your MCP client:
30 | 
31 | ```json
32 | {
33 |   "mcpServers": {
34 |     "perplexica": {
35 |       "command": "uv",
36 |       "args": ["run", "/path/to/perplexica-mcp/perplexica_mcp_tool.py"]
37 |     }
38 |   }
39 | }
40 | ```
41 | 
42 | ## Usage
43 | 
44 | This MCP server provides a `search` tool that can be used by MCP clients to perform searches through Perplexica. The tool accepts the following parameters:
45 | 
46 | ### Search Tool Parameters
47 | 
48 | - `query` (required): The search query string
49 | - `focus_mode` (required): The search focus mode
50 | - `chat_model` (optional): Chat model configuration
51 | - `embedding_model` (optional): Embedding model configuration
52 | - `optimization_mode` (optional): Performance optimization setting
53 | - `history` (optional): Conversation history
54 | - `system_instructions` (optional): Custom AI guidance
55 | - `stream` (optional): Whether to stream responses
56 | 
57 | ### Example Usage via MCP Client
58 | 
59 | When connected to an MCP client, you can use the search tool like this:
60 | 
61 | ```
62 | Search for "Python programming best practices" using webSearch focus mode
63 | ```
64 | 
65 | The MCP client will automatically invoke the search tool with the appropriate parameters.
66 | 
67 | ## Perplexica Integration
68 | 
69 | This MCP server acts as a proxy to the Perplexica search API. All search parameters and configurations are passed through to the underlying Perplexica service:
70 | 
71 | - **Focus Modes**: Supports all Perplexica focus modes (webSearch, academicSearch, writingAssistant, wolframAlphaSearch, youtubeSearch, redditSearch)
72 | - **Model Configuration**: Passes through chat model and embedding model settings to Perplexica
73 | - **Search Options**: Forwards optimization modes, conversation history, and system instructions
74 |
